# Developers - Themes & Integrations

When using UI eXtension in a theme please **DO NOT** attempt to ship any part if the UI eXtension integration stand alone. Always guide your theme users to the UI eXtension Quick Start Guide to install the integration.

When using UI eXtension alongside another custom integration, please set UI eXtension as a dependency in your `manifest.json`. That way users will required to install UI eXtension before they can use your integration.

If you have any question please start a [GitHb discussion](https://github.com/Lint-Free-Technology/uix/discussions).
