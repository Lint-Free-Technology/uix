Patch ha-panel-profile for theme styling
Config panels are routed via removing last Child and adding a new one.
Hence we need to prepend uix element to not interfere with the routing.

There is no style passed to apply_uix here, everything comes only from themes.

This will only work if uix loaded as a Frontend module.
